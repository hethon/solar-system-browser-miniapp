    "features": [
        "Uranus is an ice giant with a thick atmosphere composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane.",
        "It is unique among the planets in the Solar System because it rotates on its side, with its axis of rotation nearly parallel to its orbital plane.",

            "Titania": "Titania is the largest moon of Uranus and the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System.",
            "Oberon": "Oberon is the second-largest moon of Uranus and has a heavily cratered surface.",
            "Umbriel": "Umbriel is the third-largest moon of Uranus and has a dark, heavily cratered surface.",
            "Ariel": "Ariel is the fourth-largest moon of Uranus and has a relatively smooth surface with few impact craters.",
            "Miranda": "Miranda is the smallest and innermost of the five major moons of Uranus, known for its complex and varied terrain.",

    "life": [
        "Uranus is a gas giant and lacks a solid surface, making it inhospitable to life as we know it.",
        "Its extreme cold temperatures and high atmospheric pressure would pose significant challenges for any potential life forms."
    ],

    "fun_fact": [
        "Uranus is often referred to as an 'ice giant' because its interior contains more icy materials such as water, ammonia, and methane compared to Jupiter and Saturn.",
        "Its unique sideways rotation may have been caused by a collision with a massive object early in its history.",
