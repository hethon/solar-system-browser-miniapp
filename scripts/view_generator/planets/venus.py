        "Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid that reflect sunlight.",

    "life": [
        "Venus' surface conditions, with extreme temperatures and pressures, make it inhospitable to life as we know it.",
        "However, some scientists hypothesize that microbial life may exist in the upper atmosphere, where conditions are more temperate.",

    "fun_fact": [
        "Venus is often referred to as Earth's 'sister planet' because of their similar size and composition, but their environments are vastly different.",
        "It rotates on its axis very slowly and in the opposite direction to most other planets in the Solar System, a phenomenon known as retrograde rotation."
